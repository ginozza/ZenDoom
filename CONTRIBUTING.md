# Contributing to Zendoom

Thank you for considering contributing to Zendoom! To ensure the safety and quality of the project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

## Code Review

- All contributions must undergo a code review process. Pull requests will be reviewed by project maintainers before being merged.
- Code reviews will include an assessment of security and potential system impact.

## Security and Protection

- Contributions that introduce security vulnerabilities will not be accepted. This includes issues such as input validation failures, code injections, and exposure of sensitive data.
- Code that interacts with networks or external systems must be reviewed carefully to prevent attacks like injections, buffer overflows, and other security issues.

## Testing

- Automated or manual tests must be provided with each pull request to ensure that new code does not introduce errors or vulnerabilities.
- Contributions affecting security functionality must include test cases to verify that no new vulnerabilities are introduced.

## Compliance with Standards

- All code must follow the project's style guidelines and best practices.
- Static analysis and security tools should be used to check code quality and security before submitting a pull request.

## Documentation

- Contributions must include adequate documentation for any new code or functionality.
- Documentation should include a clear description of the functionality and its relevance to project security.

## Authenticity and Authorization

- Contributors must provide a digital signature or confirmation that they have the necessary rights to contribute code and that the code is original and does not infringe on copyrights or licenses.
- Contributions including third-party code must comply with relevant licenses and authorization.

## Reporting Security Issues

- Report security issues confidentially and responsibly. Use a private communication channel to report vulnerabilities instead of disclosing details publicly.

## Execution in Controlled Environments

- Contributions involving network or security configuration changes should be tested in controlled environments before being deployed in production.

## Acceptable Behavior

- Maintain professional and respectful behavior in all project interactions. Contributions must adhere to the project's code of conduct.
